  &#127925; Radr (<i>Music Radar</i>) is a free and simple way to track new releases from your favourite artists.<br>
  Once a day, Spotify is checked for any new releases and emails you if an artist you follow has released a new album, single or compilation.<br>
  You do not need a Spotify account to use the service. Most artists distribute their new releases on all main streaming services, (Spotify, Google Play Music, Apple Music, etc.) at the same time.<br>
  I have taken inspiration and some ideas from <a href="https://muspy.com/">Muspy</a>. Unfortunately, it is no longer maintained, so I have taken it upon myself to create a replacement.<br>
  This is still a work in progress with cool features in development, but the intended functionality is active.<br>
